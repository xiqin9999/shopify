Ingredients

[ingredients]
4 mini pumpkins (about 1 pound each)
4 ounces sweet or hot bulk sausage
5 eggs
4 pieces stale bread (any nonsweet kind), cut into cubes
1 tablespoon minced fresh sage, or 1 teaspoon dried
1 tablespoon minced Italian parsley
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground pepper
4 teaspoons crème fraîche (optional)
[/ingredients]

Directions

[directions]

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Slice the top quarter off each pumpkin and remove the seeds and stringy bits.
In a medium skillet over medium-high heat, sauté the sausage for 3 to 4 minutes, until cooked through. Drain off any rendered fat and set aside.
Whisk 1 of the eggs, and toss it in a large bowl with the sausage, bread cubes, sage, parsley, salt, and pepper until well combined.
Fill each pumpkin with the stuffing mixture to a little less than 1 inch from the top, and place it on the prepared sheet. Bake for 40 minutes, until the pumpkins have soft- ened. Remove the pan from the oven and use a spoon to compress the stuffing a little. Pour 1 of the remaining 4 eggs into each pumpkin. Lightly cover the pumpkins with a sheet of aluminum foil. Increase the heat to 400 degrees F and return the sheet to the oven. Bake for another 10 minutes, until the eggs are just set.
Serve hot, topped with about a teaspoon of crème fraîche and more salt and pepper to taste.

Ingredients

[ingredients]

2 medium eggplants
2 teaspoons of salt, divided in half
1 cup extra-virgin olive oil
1/3 cup balsamic vinegar
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1 1/2 pounds zucchini
3 large red onions
2 medium red bell peppers
2 medium yellow bell peppers
6 large heads of endive
Garnish: 4 sprigs fresh basil
[/ingredients]

Directions

[directions]
Place a layer of paper towels over a baking sheet. Arrange the eggplant in single layers and sprinkle with 1 teaspoon of salt. Let stand for 30 minutes. Pat dry.
Preheat the oven to 450°F.
Prepare vegetables. Unpeel eggplants and cut them crosswise into 1/4-inch thick rounds. Wash and dry zucchini, and cut on the bias into 1/4-inch rounds. Slice onions into 1/4-inch rounds. Core and seed red and yellow bell peppers, and cut into 3/4-inch squares. Core endive, after that half and quarter lengthwise.
Whisk together the olive oil, vinegar, remaining salt, and pepper, and set aside.
Divide the eggplant, zucchini, red onions, peppers, and endive between 2 large baking pans with sides. Gently toss the vegetables with 3/4 of the blended oil and vinegar. Place 1 baking sheet on the bottom oven rack and the second on the middle rack. Roast the vegetables for 15 to 20 minutes, turning them once and rotating the pans between the shelves after 10 minutes. The vegetables should be crisp to the bite when they are done.
Arrange the vegetables in colorful bunches on round or oval platters, mixing together the different types of vegetables. Sprinkle the vegetables with salt and pepper, and drizzle them with the remaining olive oil/balsamic vinegar dressing. Serve at room temperature.

Ingredients

[ingredients]
Nonstick vegetable oil spray
8 medium Fuji apples
1 cup sugar
6 tablespoons water
1/4 cup (1/2 stick) unsalted butter
1 sheet frozen puff pastry (half of 17.3-ounce package), thawed
[/ingredients]

Directions

[directions]
Position rack in top third of oven and preheat to 425°F. Spray 8-inch-diameter cake pan with 3-inch-high sides with nonstick spray. Peel, quarter and core apples; place in bowl and set aside.
Combine sugar and 6 tablespoons water in heavy medium saucepan. Stir over medium heat until sugar dissolves, occasionally brushing down sides of pan with wet pastry brush. Increase heat and boil without stirring until syrup is deep amber, occasionally brushing down sides of pan with wet pastry brush and swirling pan, about 10 minutes. Remove pan from heat. Add butter (caramel will bubble vigorously); stir to blend. Pour caramel into prepared pan. Let cool 5 minutes.
Working carefully, stand apples on end in concentric circles in pan, crowding together as much as possible. Cut any remaining apple quarters into thin wedges; insert into empty spaces. Place pan directly over medium heat and bring caramel to simmer, about 2 minutes.
Place pan in oven; bake until apples are tender and caramel bubbles thickly, occasionally pressing apples lightly with spatula to compact, about 1 1/2 hours.
Meanwhile, unfold pastry sheet on work surface. Using 9-inch tart pan bottom as aid, cut out 9-inch round; pierce all over with fork. Chill until ready to use.
Remove pan from oven. Top apples with pastry; tuck in edges. Return to oven; bake until pastry is golden, about 20 minutes. Transfer pan to rack. Cool tart completely in pan, about 3 hours.
Place platter atop pan. Hold platter and pan and invert; tart will fall out onto platter. Cut into wedges and serve.

Ingredients

[ingredients]
1.5 (15 ounce) packages refrigerated pie crusts, divided
6 medium granny smith apples, peeled and sliced (about 6 cups)
1 1⁄2 tablespoons lemon juice
3⁄4 cup firmly packed brown sugar
1⁄2 cup granulated sugar
1⁄3 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1⁄2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
[/ingredients]

Directions

[directions]
Unroll and stack 2 pie crusts; gently roll or press together.
Fit pastry into a 9 inch deep-dish pie plate.
Toss together apples and lemon juice in a large bowl.
Combine brown sugar, granulated sugar, and next 3 ingredients; sprinkle over apple mixture and toss to coat.
Spoon into prepared pie crust.
Unroll and place remaining pie crust over filling.
Fold edges under, and crimp; cut slits in top for steam to escape. (I also cover the crimped edges of my crust with foil to prevent burning).
Bake at 450 degrees for 15 minutes. Reduce temperature to 350 degrees, and bake for 30-35 minutes.

Ingredients

[ingredients]
1-2 Empire Apples, cored and sliced as thin as possible
Squeeze of lemon juice
Flour, to dust
1 sheet frozen puff pastry, thawed
3 tablespoons apricot preserves
1/8 teaspoon cinnamon
[/ingredients]

Directions

[directions]

Lightly butter a muffin tin. Preheat the oven to 375°F.
Place the apple slices in a bowl with the lemon juice and cover with water. Microwave until the slices are slightly softened, about 3 minutes.
Lightly flour your workspace and roll out the puff pastry as thin as possible, keeping it in a rectangular shape. You want the pastry to be fairly thin – if you leave the puff too thick, it will have issues baking all the way through. Trim the pastry into 6 or 12 strips, depending on if you are making mini or regular roses.
Mix the apricot preserves with 2 tablespoons of hot water and stir well. Brush onto the puff pastry. Place the apple slices on the puff, about halfway down, overlapping. Sprinkle with a touch of cinnamon, if using. Fold up the puff pastry and gently roll up, placing into the prepared tin when done.
Bake until puff is golden brown and cooked through, 40-45 minutes. If the apples start to brown too much, cover with a piece of foil. Remove, let cool, and enjoy!

Ingredients

[ingredients]
1/2 cup walnuts, coarsely chopped, divided
4 tablespoons olive oil, divided
1 medium onion, finely chopped
1 cup arborio rice
Kosher salt, freshly ground pepper
1/2 cup dry white wine
1 small garlic clove
1 cup (packed) fresh parsley leaves
3 tablespoons chopped fresh chives
2 cups torn Tuscan kale leaves, divided
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
3 ounces Parmesan, finely grated (about 2 cups)
[/ingredients]

Directions

[directions]
Preheat oven to 350°. Toast walnuts on a rimmed baking sheet, tossing occasionally, until golden brown, 8–10 minutes. Let cool.
Meanwhile, heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large ovenproof saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and cook, stirring often, until softened and translucent, 5–8 minutes. Stir in rice; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring, until some grains are translucent, about 5 minutes.
Add wine, bring to a simmer, and cook until pan is almost dry, about 3 minutes. Add 2 cups very hot water; season with salt and pepper. Bring to a simmer, cover, and bake in oven until liquid is mostly absorbed but rice is still starchy in the center, 15–18 minutes (it should be undercooked).
Meanwhile, pulse garlic and half of toasted walnuts in a food processor until very finely ground. Add parsley, chives, half of kale, remaining 2 tablespoons oil, and 1/4 cup cold water; process until smooth; season pesto with salt and pepper.
Set saucepan over medium heat. Add 3/4 cup very hot water and cook rice, stirring constantly, until it is tender but still has some bite and sauce is creamy, about 3 minutes. Stir in pesto, butter, three-quarters of Parmesan, and remaining kale. Adjust consistency with water, if needed; season with salt and pepper. Serve topped with remaining walnuts and cheese.

Ingredients

[ingredients]
30 threads saffron, crushed
4 chicken thighs
10-12 large shrimps, peeled and deveined
salt and freshly ground pepper, to taste
1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil
1 tablespoon Red Mixed Spice
1/2 tablespoon smoked paprika
3 cloves garlic
3 medium tomatoes
1 small onion
7 cups chicken broth
2 1/2 cups short-grain rice
1 red pepper
12 clams
[/ingredients]

Directions

[directions]
Put saffron and 1⁄4 cup hot water in a small bowl; let sit for 15 minutes. Season chicken and shrimp with salt and pepper. Heat oil in a 16″–18″ paella pan over medium-high heat. Add chicken, shrimp, and chorizo and cook, turning occasionally, until browned, about 5 minutes.
Transfer shrimp to a plate, leaving meats in pan. Add paprika, garlic, tomatoes, and onions to pan and cook, stirring often, until onions soften, about 6 minutes. Add reserved saffron mixture and broth, season with salt, and bring to a boil over high heat.
Sprinkle in rice, distribute evenly with a spoon, and add peppers. Cook, without stirring, until rice has absorbed most of the liquid, 12-15 minutes. (If your pan is larger than the burner, rotate it every two minutes so different parts are over the heat and the rice cooks evenly.)
Reduce heat to low, add reserved shrimp, and nestle in clams hinge side down; cook, without stirring, until clams have opened and rice has absorbed the liquid and is al dente, 5–10 minutes more. Turn heat to high for 1-2 minutes to create the socarrat. Remove pan from heat, cover with aluminum foil, and let sit for 5 minutes before enjoying.

Ingredients

[ingredients]
1/2 pound angel hair pasta
3/4 pound raw, peeled, deveined shrimp (medium sized)
4 ripe Campari Tomatoes
3 cloves garlic, minced
1/3 cup torn fresh basil leaves
3 Tbsp olive oil (divided, 1 Tbsp and 2 Tbsp)
Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
[/ingredients]

Directions

[directions]
Fill a large pot with 2 quarts of water. Bring to a boil (You will be using this water to both blanch the tomatoes and boil the pasta.) Core the tomatoes and use a sharp knife to cut a small X into the bottom end of each tomato. When the water is boiling, use a slotted spoon to lower the tomatoes into the water. Blanch for no more than one minute, just enough to loosen the skins. Remove tomatoes with a slotted spoon to a bowl of icy water, saving the blanching water.
Peel off the tomato skins from the tomatoes. Cut the tomatoes crosswise in half, and squeeze out most of the seeds and juices. Chop the tomatoes into 1-inch pieces.
Heat 1 Tbsp of olive oil in a large sauté pan on medium high heat. Add the shrimp to the pan and cook for 1 minute. Turn the shrimp over in the pan. Lower the heat to medium.
Add the garlic, cook a minute more. Add the chopped tomatoes and basil. Sprinkle with salt. Cook for a minute more and remove from heat.
Add a tablespoon of salt to the water you used to blanch the tomatoes. Bring to a boil again. Add the angel hair pasta and cook for 3 minutes.
Drain the pasta and immediately add to pot with the shrimp and tomatoes. Drizzle the pasta with 2 Tbsp of olive oil. Then stir the pasta in with the shrimp and tomatoes. Serve immediately or at room temp.

Ingredients

[ingredients]
4 ripe but firm yellow peaches
2-3 Tbsp chopped shallots or onions
2-3 jalapenos
Lemon juice
2 Tbsp chopped fresh mint
2 Tbsp grated ginger
1 teaspoon sugar
Salt and black pepper to taste
[/ingredients]

Directions

[directions]
Prepare peaches. Skin on or off, your choice, skin on makes for better color, but if skin is too thick or fuzzy you may want to peel first. Then chop.
Put the chopped peaches, shallots, and jalapeños in the bowl of a food processor. Add the remaining ingredients. Pulse 2-3 times, just enough to get most the pieces small and to well combine the salsa. Do not liquefy it.
Place salsa into a bowl and cover. Let stand for an hour before serving to give the ingredients time to meld.
Serve with chips, with fish, pork, or chicken.

Neither long simmering nor heat-canned, this vibrant, lightly spiced jam couldn't be simpler to prepare. Red-fleshed plums lend a gorgeous garnet color, but any variety works well. 

Ingredients

[ingredients]
1/3 cups coarsely chopped Meynard Plums (from about 1 1/4 pounds)
1 (1-inch) piece ginger (about 1 1/2 ounces)
1 1/3 cups sugar
1/4 cup Ball® RealFruit® Instant Pectin
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom
[/ingredients]

Directions

[directions]
Bring plums and 1 cup water to a boil in a medium saucepan, then reduce heat to low and simmer until plums begin to soften and liquid is reduced by about half, about 5 minutes.
Meanwhile, finely grate ginger, then squeeze juice into a small bowl; discard pulp.
Combine sugar and pectin in a large bowl. Add plum mixture, lemon juice, pepper, cardamom, and 1 tsp. ginger juice (discard any remaining juice), then stir constantly for about 3 minutes to activate pectin. Using a potato masher or fork, break up any large plum pieces, then let cool at least 30 minutes.
Ladle jam into sterilized jars, leaving 1/2 from the top to allow for expansion. Cover and chill.

Ingredients

[ingredients]
Pastry dough for a single-crust pie
2 tablespoons semolina flour
8 tablespoons granulated sugar
5 large red plums (1 1/2 lb), halved, pitted, and each cut lengthwise into 8 wedges
1 tablespoon confectioners sugar
3/4 cup creame frache or sour cream
1 tablespoon Armagnac or Cognac (optional)
Special equipment: parchment paper
[/ingredients]

Directions

[directions]
Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 375°F. Line a large (17- by 12-inch) baking sheet with parchment paper.
Roll out dough on a lightly floured surface with a lightly floured rolling pin into a 13-inch round. Transfer to baking sheet.
Stir together semolina flour and 2 tablespoons granulated sugar and spread evenly over dough, leaving a 1-inch border. Arrange plums, skin sides down, in 1 layer on top of sugar mixture, then sprinkle plums with 3 tablespoons granulated sugar. Fold in edge of dough to cover outer rim of plums, pleating dough as necessary.
Bake galette, loosely covered with a sheet of foil, 40 minutes. Remove foil and bake until fruit is tender and juices are bubbling, about 5 minutes more.
Transfer galette on baking sheet to a rack and immediately brush hot juices over plums using a pastry brush. Dust hot galette with confectioners sugar. Cool to warm or room temperature, about 30 minutes.

Ingredients

[ingredients]
8 medium radishes, very thinly sliced
Kosher salt
1 tablespoon pine nuts
1 1/4 cups low-fat plain Greek yogurt
1/2 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest, plus more for serving
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
3 tablespoons olive oil, divided
Freshly ground black pepper
Cucumber spears (for serving)
[/ingredients]

Directions

[directions]
Toss radishes in a small bowl with a couple pinches of salt. Let sit until salt begins to draw out water from radishes, about 5 minutes.
Meanwhile, toast pine nuts in a medium skillet over medium-high heat, tossing often, until golden brown, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a small bowl and let cool.
Massage radishes to release liquid, gently at first, then more vigorously as they start to expel water. Squeeze out excess liquid, then finely chop radishes (you should have about 1 cup).Add oil and salt and pulse again until well combined.
Mix radishes, yogurt, lemon juice, 2 Tbsp. oil, and 1/2 tsp. lemon zest in a medium bowl; season with salt and pepper.
Divide yogurt among bowls, top with pine nuts and more lemon zest and drizzle with remaining 1 Tbsp. oil. Serve with cucumber spears for dipping.
Yogurt can be made 3 days ahead; cover and chill. Top with pine nuts and lemon zest just before serving.

Ingredients

[ingredients]
5 red bell peppers
2 small garlic cloves, very thinly sliced
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh oregano
3/4 teaspoon coarse sea salt
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
[/ingredients]

Directions

[directions]
Prepare grill for cooking. If using a charcoal grill, open vents on bottom of grill, then light charcoal. Charcoal fire is hot when you can hold your hand 5 inches above rack for 1 to 2 seconds. If using a gas grill, preheat burners on high, covered, 10 minutes, then reduce heat to moderately high.
Lay bell peppers on their sides on lightly oiled grill rack and roast, turning occasionally with tongs, until skins are blackened, 10 to 12 minutes.
Transfer to a bowl, then cover and let steam 10 minutes. Peel and seed peppers (reserving juices), then cut into 1/4-inch-thick strips.
Stir together peppers (with their juices), garlic, oil, vinegar, oregano, sea salt, and pepper and marinate 30 minutes at room temperature.

Ingredients

[ingredients]
6 medium red onions, skin on, roots intact
6 tablespoons olive oil, divided
Salt (smoked is delicious here)
Herbs-either a few bay leaves or a few sprigs of rosemary and thyme
Freshly ground black pepper
[/ingredients]

Directions

[directions]
Preheat oven to 350°.
Make a total of 4 vertical cuts in each onion to create 8 wedges still attached at the root end.
Drizzle a little of the olive oil into a baking dish, then arrange onions root end down.
Spoon remaining olive oil into and around onions. Sprinkle generously with salt, getting some into the center of the onions. Toss in herbs.
Roast for 40 minutes. Rearrange onions so that their petals open, and drizzle with a few spoonfuls of the caramelized onion juices from the pan. Roast until onions are tender on the inside with crispy bits on their outer petals, about 20 minutes longer. Season with pepper and more salt to taste. Serve hot or at room temperature as a side dish, or as dinner with a good cheese and a green salad.

Ingredients

[ingredients]
1 small kabocha squash or large acorn squash (1 pound), scrubbed
1 1-pound delicata squash, scrubbed, cut into 1"-thick wedges or rings, seeded
7 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided
1 1/2 teaspoons cumin seeds, divided
Kosher salt, freshly ground pepper
4 scallions, cut into 2" pieces
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
1 tablespoon tahini (sesame seed paste)
Aleppo pepper or crushed red pepper flakes
[/ingredients]

Directions

[directions]
Arrange racks in upper and lower thirds of oven; preheat to 425°F. Place kabocha on a rimmed baking sheet and delicata on a second sheet. Divide 3 tablespoons oil and 1 1/4 teaspoons cumin between sheets. Season squash with salt and pepper; toss. Roast for 15 minutes.
Combine remaining 1/4 teaspoon cumin, 1 tablespoon oil, and scallions in a small bowl; season with salt and pepper and toss to evenly coat. Scatter scallion mixture over squash, dividing evenly between sheets, and continue to roast until squash is tender but not mushy, about 15 minutes longer (time may vary depending on squash).
Meanwhile, whisk lemon juice, tahini, and 1 tablespoon water in a small bowl to blend. Gradually whisk in remaining 3 tablespoons oil. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
Transfer squash to a platter. Drizzle tahini sauce over and sprinkle with Aleppo pepper.

Ingredients

[ingredients]
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 tablespoons Paprika & Cayenne Pepper Mixed Spice
2 teaspoons tomato paste
2 large red peppers, cut into 1/4-inch / 0.5cm dice (2 cups / 300 g in total)
4 cloves garlic, finely chopped
1 teaspoon ground cumin
5 large, very ripe tomatoes, chopped
4 large free-range eggs, plus 4 egg yolks
1/2 cup / 120 g labneh or thick yogurt
Salt
[/ingredients]

Directions

[directions]
Heat the olive oil in a large frying pan over medium heat and add the pilpelchuma or harissa, tomato paste, peppers, garlic, cumin, and 3/4 teaspoon salt. Stir and cook over medium heat for about 8 minutes to allow the peppers to soften. Add the tomatoes, bring to a gentle simmer, and cook for a further 10 minutes until you have quite a thick sauce. Taste for seasoning.
Make 8 little dips in the sauce. Gently break the eggs and carefully pour each into its own dip. Do the same with the yolks. Use a fork to swirl the egg whites a little bit with the sauce, taking care not to break the yolks. Simmer gently for 8 to 10 minutes, until the egg whites are set but the yolks are still runny (you can cover the pan with a lid if you wish to hasten the process). Remove from the heat, leave for a couple of minutes to settle, then spoon into individual plates and serve with the labneh or yogurt.

Ingredients

[ingredients]
1 10-ounce package frozen chopped spinach, thawed1 garlic
1/2 cup crumbled feta
1/4 cup minced onion
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 teaspoon chopped dill
1 teaspoon minced garlic
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
2 large eggs
1 sheet frozen puff pastry (from a 17.3-ounces package), thawed, rolled out to a 12" square, kept chilled
6-cup muffin pan
[/ingredients]

Directions

[directions]
Using your hands, squeeze spinach until dry, forcing out as much water as possible (too much water will make for a soggy filling; you should have about 2/3 cup well-drained spinach). Mix spinach and next 5 ingredients in a medium bowl. Season to taste with salt and pepper. In a small bowl, beat 1 egg to blend; fold into spinach mixture.
Cut puff pastry into 3 equal strips. Reserve 1 strip for another use. Cut each remaining strip into 3 squares for a total of 6. Place a square in each muffin cup, pressing into bottom and up sides and leaving corners pointing up. Divide filling among cups. Fold pastry over filling, pressing corners together to meet in center. DO AHEAD: Spinach puffs can be assembled 3 hours ahead. Cover puffs and chill.
Preheat oven to 400°F. Beat remaining egg to blend in a small bowl. Brush pastry with egg wash (this will give the pastry a nice sheen). Bake until pastry is golden brown and puffed, about 25 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack; let puffs cool in pan for 10 minutes. Run a sharp paring knife around pan edges to loosen; turn out puffs onto rack to cool slightly before serving.

Ingredients

[ingredients]
1 1/2 tablespoons Cognac (optional)
1 cup Thompson Seedless Grapes, halved
3/4 cup whole blanched almonds (3 3/4 ounces)
1/2 cup sugar
1 stick (1/2 cup) unsalted butter, softened
3/4 teaspoon vanilla
2 large eggs
1/3 cup all-purpose flour
1/8 teaspoon salt
[/ingredients]

Directions

[directions]
Put oven rack in upper third of oven and preheat oven to 400°F.
If using Cognac, toss grapes with it in a small bowl.
Pulse half of almonds with 1 tablespoon sugar in a blender until finely ground. Transfer to a small bowl and repeat with remaining almonds and 1 more tablespoon sugar.
Beat together butter and remaining 6 tablespoons sugar in a bowl with an electric mixer at high speed until pale and fluffy, then beat in vanilla. Add eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Reduce speed to low and beat in ground almonds, flour, and salt until just combined.
Divide batter among gratin dishes and press grapes lightly into a batter (discard Cognac). Bake in dishes on a baking sheet until cake is firm and pale golden with slightly darker edges, about 20 minutes.
Transfer cakes to a rack and cool slightly in dishes before serving.
